## Ingredients

4 cups coffee concentrate*

4 cups whole milk

1/2 cup caramel syrup

## Directions

Mix coffee concentrate and milk in 1/2 gallon pitcher. Stir in caramel syrup and refrigerate. Pour over ice and enjoy!

I use Torani caramel sauce personally. Using that, I calculate 1 cup of the finished mixture is about 205 calories.

*Coffee concentrate directions. Make coffee using 1 cup of coffee to 4 cups of water. I do the cold brew method and let it sit overnight.
